Now, you maybe asking what we mean by \"cohort\" and why you might be interested in *creating* one, or maybe what it even means to \"create\" a cohort.  The TCGA dataset includes clinical, biospecimen, and molecular data from over 10,000 cancer patients who agreed to be a part of this landmark research project to build [The Cancer Genome Atlas](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/).  This large dataset was originally organized and studied according to [cancer type](http://cancergenome.nih.gov/cancersselected) but now that this multi-year project is nearing completion, with over 30 types of cancer and over 10,000 tumors analyzed, **you** have the opportunity to look at this dataset from whichever angle most interests you.  Maybe you are particularly interested in early-onset cancers, or gastro-intestinal cancers, or a specific type of genetic mutation.  This is where the idea of a \"cohort\" comes in.  The original TCGA \"cohorts\" were based on cancer type (aka \"study\"), but now you can define a cohort based on virtually any clinical or molecular feature by querying these BigQuery tables.  A cohort is simply a list of samples, using the [TCGA barcode](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/TCGA_Barcode/) system.  Once you have created a cohort you can use it in any number of ways: you could further explore the data available for one cohort, or compare one cohort to another, for example.\n",
